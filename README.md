# Documents Marketplace for sTeX
> Source code for sTeX's decentralized documents marketplace

A mix of sTeX's document detaching API calls and this contract currently allow to:
- creating on-chain documents directly from sTeX
- placing offers to sell a document at a desired price
- placing offers to buy a document at their prices


Turrets allow our contract to run in a fairly decentralized way.
